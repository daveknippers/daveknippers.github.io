I'm Dave Knippers. I'm from Calgary, Alberta, Canada. I'm into reverse engineering, Gentoo linux, scientific computing, hazardous release and dispersion modelling, petroleum engineering, and computational fluid dynamics with OpenFOAM. I have a B.Sc. in Chemistry and a B.Sc. in Computer Science both from the University of Calgary. 

I've got a few "fun" projects on GitHub:

- [Aghanim's Wager](https://github.com/daveknippers/AghanimsWager) Requests information on live games from the Dota 2 game coordinator and provides an interactive ”gambling” interface over Discord. There's a [site in development](https://AghanimsWager.com) that displays leaderboards and other statistics.
- [KaliRoulette](https://github.com/daveknippers/KaliRoulette) Memory scanner to read real-time information from the game Spelunky, integrated with an IRC client to allow chat-interactive "gambling", which seems to be a common theme in my extracurricular projects. Unfortunately, this will likely not work as the game was patched in October 2021.
