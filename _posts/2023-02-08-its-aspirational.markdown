real talk: i want to find a dead body like they do at the start of most law and order episodes. but i don't want to make the body dead myself and i don't want it to be really fresh. i also don't want it to be so old that it's mostly decomposed or just bones. just a good old fashioned "hey there's a boot attached to a leg sticking out of the trash can"
